# esp32s3 BLE example

To run this example, you should have latest Rust in **esp** channel and `esp-idf` toolchain installed. The full instruction of installing `esp-idf` toolchain can be found [here](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/installation/index.html) and [here](https://docs.esp-rs.org/std-training/02_2_software.html)

To run the example, make sure that you have esp-idf environment, `ldproxy` and `espflash` installed correctly. Then, run 

```
cd examples/use_rust/esp32s3_ble
cargo run --release
```

If everything is good, you'll see the log as the following:

```shell
cargo run --release
