# RMK 

RMK is a feature-rich and easy-to-use keyboard firmware.

## Use the template

To run this firmware, you should have latest Rust installed. The full instruction of installing esp Rust toolchain can be found [here](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/installation/index.html).

[`espflash`](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash) should also be installed:

```
cargo install cargo-espflash espflash
```

After having everything installed, use the following command to run the example:

```
cargo run --release
```

If everything is good, you'll see the log as the following:

```shell
cargo run --release  
    Compiling ...
    ...
    ...

```

If espflash reports the following error:

```
Error: espflash::connection_failed

  × Error while connecting to device
  ╰─▶ Serial port not found
```

You should to identify which serial port are connected to your esp board, and use `--port` to specify the used serial port:

```
# Suppose that the esp board are connected to /dev/cu.usbmodem211401
cargo run --release -- --port /dev/cu.usbmodem211401
```

If you want to get some insight of segments of your binary, [`espsegs`](https://github.com/bjoernQ/espsegs) would help:

```
# Install it first
cargo install --git https://github.com/bjoernQ/espsegs

# Check all segments
espsegs target/riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf/release/rmk-esp32c6 --chip esp32c6
```
